#  100 Days of Code – DSA Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of Coding Challenge** where I commit to practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** daily and share my progress with solved problems. 
This journey is all about consistency, learning, and becoming a better problem-solver.


 **Goal**: Solve at least one DSA problem every day for 100 days.  
 **Code Access**: Visit the `src/` folder for all problem codes organized by day.



##  Day 1 

### Problems Solved:
1. **Count Digits** – A basic program to count the number of digits in an integer.
2. **Palindrome Check** – Checks whether a given number is a palindrome.
3. **Reverse Number** – Reverses the digits of a given number.
